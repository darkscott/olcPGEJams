# olcPGEJams
Messing around with the olcPixelGameEngine for some simple games.  Nothing serious, just fun.
Thank you [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) for providing something so fun for coders to play with!

# This project uses submodules
When you clone, be sure to add --recurse-submodules to your command line!
```
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo_url>
```

If you cloned and forgot to do this, you can sync them afterward by doing:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

# Folder Layout
Each game will go into its own folder
